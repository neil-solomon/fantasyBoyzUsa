FantasyBoyzUSA.com
Fantasy Boyz USA is your home for custom analytics for your Yahoo! fantasy football league. 
We give you deeper insights into matchups, league standings, and team performance throughout the season.

The goal of this project is to showcase my fullstack web development skills. It includes data organization and analysis with python,
chart creation with matplotlib, and web design using Bootstrap Studio. I will continue to add features and analytics, and I eventually
want to use a framework such as React to display live data and charts. The project currently displays data for only my fantasy football
league, but in the future I would like to add features which can display data for the fantasy football league of any user logged into the 
website.
